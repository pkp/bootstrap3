# Bootstrap3 for OJS 3.0

A community-built theme for OJS 3.0 that implements Bootstrap 3 components.

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/NateWr/bootstrap3/releases).
2. Unpack the .zip file and move the `bootstrap3` directory to your OJS installation at `/plugins/themes/bootstrap3`.
3. Login to the admin area of your OJS website. Browse to the Settings > Website > Plugins page and enable the Bootstrap 3 theme.
4. Browse to the Settings > Website > Appearance page and select Bootstrap 3 from the theme option and save your change.

You can now see the Bootstrap 3 theme on your website. Go back to the Settings > Website > Appearance page (or refresh the page if it is still open) to view options to switch to any of the bundled Bootstrap 3 themes.

## Project Aims

This project was born at the [2016 PKP Sprint](https://pkp.sfu.ca/2016/04/29/sprinting-in-montreal/) in Montreal. It aims to provide a common starting point for anyone who wants to build a custom theme for OJS 3.0.

The goal was to stay true to Bootstrap 3's core components, so that developers familiar with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework can more easily read and customize the code base. By sticking close to Bootstrap 3's supported components, the theme is able to more easily leverage the many existing Bootstrap 3 resources out there.

## Contribution

This theme is a work-in-progress. It may not support all features of OJS 3.0 and some of the bundled themes could use some polish. It's intended to act as a base for custom development, but many journals may use it out-of-the-box.

If you see something that could be improved, please issue a Pull Request.
